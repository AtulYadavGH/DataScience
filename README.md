## Arithmetic Expression Examples
### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

## Multiplication and Addition
```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)

Output:
17

Minutes to Hours Conversion
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
hours = 200 / 60
print(hours)

Output:
3.3333333333333335
